# Claude Code Skills

A collection of custom commands and systems for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that extend its capabilities with specialized workflows.

Each skill lives in its own folder — install only what you need.

## 🗂️ [AI Personal OS](./ai-personal-os/) — Goal Planning System

A complete personal productivity system. Instead of Notion or Todoist, you get an AI partner that actively thinks with you — planning your day, tracking habits, running weekly reviews, and keeping you aligned with your goals.

**Includes:** `/coach`, `/goals`, `/weekly-review`, `/monthly-review` commands + full goal hierarchy file structure.

→ [Installation & docs](./ai-personal-os/README.md)

## 🎯 [Board of Advisors](./board-of-advisors/) — Multi-Perspective Decision Making

Convene a virtual board of advisors to get multi-perspective feedback on any question or decision. Choose real people (Paul Graham, Naval Ravikant, Andrej Karpathy) or roles (investor, skeptic, strategist) — each responds in their own voice.
